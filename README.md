# javascriptTodoList
My JavaScript code creates a task list manager that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks on a web page. It maintains a `task List` array to store tasks.
 Key functions include:

render Tasks (): Renders tasks onto the HTML page, displaying each task with an 'Edit' and 'Delete' button.
add Task (): Adds a new task to the `task List` array when the user submits a task through an input field.
edit Task(index): Allows users to edit a task by prompting them for a new task and updating the task in the `task List` array.
delete Task(index): Enables users to delete a task after approving their decision.

The code ensures that the task list is always up-to-date by calling render Tasks () whenever a task is added, edited, or deleted
